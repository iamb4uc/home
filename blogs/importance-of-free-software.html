        <h1>Importance free software for privacy and security</h1>
        <p>Created and posted by b4uc on Jun 07th 2022</p>

      <p>When I talk about free software in public, people usually normies think that I am talking about free as in price, tho I do agree that some basic pieces of software such as system software, application software and utility software do need to be free, I also refer the term <b>FREE as in FREEDOM</b>, freedom here mean the liberty to change, modify and audit the code and the structure of a piece of software. This don't particularly mean that the software should never make profits for its company or creator, this just puts privacy and security of the end user before money.</p>
      <p>A creator can make free software and still earn money from it. You can find more about this topic <a href="https://opensource.guide/getting-paid/">here</a> </p>
      <p>With popular free software, you have many people actively auditing, editing and keeping an active eye on the development, which makes vulnerabilities or exploits to pass on to a release.</p>
      <p>Some of the common questions I get from normies are</p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>If everyone can see its code people can use this code to find vulnerabilities and then exploit it so its not safe.</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>First of all just avoid this people, they suck BillyG's cuck and will never convert to free software or know how important it is to most of us to maintain our privacy and anonymity these people usually use windows 11 and have an iphone or a generic google dipped android shit.</p>
