      <p>When I talk about free software in public, people usually normies think that I am talking about free as in price, tho I do agree that some basic pieces of software such as system software, application software and utility software do need to be free, I also refer the term <b>FREE as in FREEDOM</b>, freedom here mean the liberty to change, modify and audit the code and the structure of a piece of software. This don't particularly mean that the software should never make profits for its company or creator, this just puts privacy and security of the end user before money.</p>
      <p>A creator can make free software and still earn money from it. You can find more about this topic <a href="https://opensource.guide/getting-paid/">here</a> </p>
      <p>With popular free software, you have many people actively auditing, editing and keeping an active eye on the development, which makes vulnerabilities or exploits to pass on to a release.</p>
      <p>Some of the common questions I get from normies are</p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>If everyone can see its code people can use this code to find vulnerabilities and then exploit it so its not safe.</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>First of all just avoid this people, they suck BillyG's cuck and will never convert to free software or know how important it is to most of us to maintain our privacy and anonymity these people usually use windows 11 and have an iphone or a generic google dipped android shit.</p>
      <p>Ok enough talking shit, lets get down to the main point of writing this blog.</p>
      <p>Propiratory software donot disclose about what they collect from you they sometimes can really obtain some granular details like you geolocation, address, or even your most visited locations like your workplace. While this are <em>*mostly*</em> used for targeted ads, but you cannot be certain if they use it for anything other than that, usually propiratory software can be used as modern day wiretaps used by governments to spy on its public and Edward Snowden proved that this practice actually exits and isnt a hoax or conspiracy.</p>
      <p>When you use free and open-source software, you have all the freedom of checking for backdoors, audit all of its code and even if you arn't tech-savy you can still have the assureance that a large group of people already are actively checking for vulnerabilities and bugs and other sensitive code that can be exploited.</p>
      <p>Again this is my own opinion, if you dont want to take your privacy seriously, you can go fuck youself but if you want to protect yourself you can use some "well known" FOSS projects.</p>
