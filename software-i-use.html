    <p>Here's a comprehensive list of the software I use on a daily basis, and the reason why I use them instead of others will be given besides them too. This page will be very long. So you can click the sub-headers on the side bar to jump to a certain topic.</p>

      <h2 id="os">Q: What operating system do you use?</h2>
      <p>Well the answer is pretty easy, its GNU/Linux and BSD. Well to be precise I currently have Arch Linux, Void Linux on my laptop and both of them have their own purpose. I use Arch for Its repo, tho i tried using Artix since I hate systemd I kindda dont like it, I like original distro without it being based on something else. And I use Void for its minimalism, I love runnit, its fast, snappy and very <em>fun</em> to manage.</p>
      <p>Besides that, I run debain on my server, Gentoo and openbsd on my desktop.</p>
      In short:
      <ol>
        <li> <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> </li>
        <li> <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a> </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a></li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="dmnwm">Q: What Desktop Environment(DE) or Window Manager(WM) do you use?</h2>
      <p>I dont use any desktop environment since I find them bloated with useless <em>shit</em> they market as features and have a billion of dependencies. I use <b>DWM</b> as my main window manager since it is written in C, it is easy for me to customize and understand what each piece of code does also I prefer WM cause these are light weight and are very customizable. But if you want my recomendation on Desktop Environment, you can use <b>xfce4</b> since the base version is not as bloated as DE such as Gnome or KDE without compromising productivity.</p>
      <h5>If you want my DWM configs you can checkout either my <a href="https://github.com/iamb4uc/DWM">DWM(gruvbox_minimal)</a> files or my <a href="https://github.com/iamb4uc/dotfiles">dotfiles(dracula_DWM)</a> with some additional dotfiles.</h5>

      <h2 id="ide">Q: What IDE do you use?</h2>
      <p>I dont use IDE's since all of them are either bloated as fuck or just straight up propriatory blobs. I use vim for doing everything, its very customizeable with the features I actually need. I use VimPLUG for my plugin management</p>
