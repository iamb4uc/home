        <b>Q: What font do I use on this website?</b><br>
        A: Roboto Mono, and monospace.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Q: What do I do besides spending time on coding and programming?</b><br>
        A: I read books mostly phylosophy, tech, and other kinds of self help books. These books helps me stay positive and think the way I think.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Q: What is the purpose of this website?</b><br>
        A: Not much to be honest, its a personal project, since I am a completely self taught programmer and cybersecurity practitionar, I like to do real world projects just to find new fields to explore and broden my knowledge, also since some of the people who build webpages for a living use some much bloat on their webpages, its kind of a parody of their way of coding, I am lazy and I like doing work efficiently so I use as less resources I can. This website is purely for demonstrating how easy it is to use a webpage without using any complex and confusing UI or code for the end user, I dont use animation since it is mostly used as makeup for ugly code. These pages load lightning fast compare to website that use a shit ton of css and javascript.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Q: What books do I recommend?</b><br>
        A: Currently I am just reading programming books for Rust and Haskell, but I will soon add a book recomendation page on this webite. This wont even be affiliate links so you can buy them without having a fear of loosing your Opsec.
