          <p>Hey there, I am <b>b4uc</b>. I am a computer science student that loves to tinker with gadgets. I love breaking and building stuff, I am also into hacking both hardware and software. I built this website just to let everyone understand
            the power of minimalism, because this shit loads fast and I know it. It is made to be <a href="https://suckless.org" target="_blank">"suckless"</a> by the nature of its codebase. I only used HTML5 and CSS for this website and no cookies,
            telemetry, or fancy javascript features since most of us truly do not care about flashy objects that can be used to fingerprint them.</p>
          <p>I am a great nerd when it comes to online privacy and anonymity. I believe that it is our right to be private about the things we do, may it be online browsing the web or offline living our lives. We should not give up to the mass
            servillance that our government and big tech impose on us. Unless the court orders a warrant for our name for a certain crime, we should not let them monitor our day-to-day tasks of what we do or what we like without our consent.</p>

    <h1>TL;DR</h1>
    <p><em>I am a computer science student that likes minimal software and is into cybersecurity and programming.</em></p>

    <h1>Important Note for <em>Android Chrome User</em> ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯</h1>
    <p>This website is ideal to be viewed though a computer some thing similar, the text on this website might appear way too big on chromium based browsers on android, besides that there shouldn't be any bug. Also I wont change it for the mobile
      since it will mean more line of css and its a big <b>no no</b> as my phylosophy goes also change your boomer browsers lol. If you find one please let me know via my mail, I dont open github or have any sort of push notification for github so
      mail is the best way to reach out to me.</p>
