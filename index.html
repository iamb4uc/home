    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>I am <b>b4uc</b>(pronounced as Before you see) a computer science student, a programmer, a cybersecurity aspirant, a system and network administrator and a big free and open source advocate <s> <i>all hail Richard M. Stallmen</i> </s>. I am currently working on few side projects and projects for my portfolio.</p>
    <p>This website is one of those projects. It implements <i>minimalism</i> as its standard, meaning that very few lines of code is used in making this website. This is widely known in the Linux community as the <a href="https://suckless.org" target="_blank">suckless</a> way of creating projects.</p>
    <p>One of my most favorite part of creating this website is that I suck at designing a website so also took some inspiration from the original suckless.org website and made it my own haha, everything else in here is pretty original. It took around 1 month making this completely functional. I hope to keep it updated frequently, along with blogs occasionally. This blogs will range from discussions about my projects, technology related, privacy related and sometimes life related.</p>
    <p>I deeply care about privacy in this modern world of bloated website that don't even require such features like dark mode, unnecessary JavaScript that collect user without consent or either though a big vague Terms and condition so to avoid all this, this website is 100% JavaScript free and can be accessed though any form of browser may it be <a href="https://librewolf.net/" target="_blank">librewolf</a> or <a href="https://lynx.browser.org/" target="_blank">lynx.</a> </p>
